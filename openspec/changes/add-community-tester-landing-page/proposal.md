## Why
The Community Tester App needs a professional marketing presence to attract both developers (who need testers) and potential testers. A well-designed landing page will help users understand the app's value proposition, see key features, and easily access legal information.

## What Changes
- Build a complete responsive marketing landing site using Vite + React + TypeScript
- Implement Figma-based design with hero section, features, testimonials, and CTA
- Create policy and terms pages with safe HTML rendering using DOMPurify  
- Add GSAP animations for enhanced user experience
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design and accessibility compliance
- Set up React Router for navigation (/, /policy, /terms)
- Optimize for performance and SEO with proper meta tags and image optimization

## Impact
- Affected specs: New marketing website capability
- Affected code: Complete new frontend application structure
- New dependencies: Vite, React Router, GSAP, DOMPurify, Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: Ready for static hosting (Vercel/Netlify)

## Technical Approach
- Use Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and responsive design
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger for smooth animations and scroll effects
- DOMPurify for secure HTML rendering of policy/terms content
- React Router v6 for client-side routing
- Performance optimizations: lazy loading, responsive images, meta tags
